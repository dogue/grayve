Grayve is a component library for [clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay) (using the Odin bindings) that aims to bring back the clarity and ergonomics of the Windows 9x UI. Gray box enjoyers rejoice!

This library is still in very early development and the name sucks. Everything is subject to change as I have no idea what I'm doing.
